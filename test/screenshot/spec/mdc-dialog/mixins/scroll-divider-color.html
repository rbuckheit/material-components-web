                <p>On the <span class="test-font--redact-all">24th</span> of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde
                  signalled the <span class="test-font--redact-all">three-master, the</span> Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and
                  Naples.</p>

                <p>As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,
                  got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.</p>

                <p>Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean
                  were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a
                  ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has
                  been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an
                  owner of the city.</p>

                <p>The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
                  shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
                  Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but
                  so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the
                  forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have
                  happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly
                  that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for
                  she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the
                  anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by
                  the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow
                  entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and
                  vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each
                  direction of the pilot.</p>

                <p>The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
                  affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the
                  vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled
                  alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve
                  basin.</p>

                <p>When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his
                  station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.</p>

                <p>He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black
                  eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance
                  bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from
                  their cradle to contend with danger.</p>

                <p>“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter?
                  and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”</p>

                <p>“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great
                  misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
                  Captain Leclere.”</p>

                <p>“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.</p>

                <p>“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head.
                  But poor Captain Leclere——”</p>

                <p>“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable
                  resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”</p>

                <p>“He died.”</p>

                <p>“Fell into the sea?”</p>

                <p>“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the
                  crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”</p>

                <p>All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
                  crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
                  outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
                  clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
                  orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the
                  owner.</p>

                <p>“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the
                  interrupted conversation.</p>

                <p>“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the
                  harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In
                  twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
                  afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his
                  rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head
                  and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and
                  cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a
                  melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to
                  die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”</p>

                <p>“Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted
                  at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the
                  young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me
                  that the cargo——”</p>

                <p>“Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you
                  not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”</p>

                <p>Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
                  “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”</p>

                <p>The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-
                  of-war.</p>

                <p>“Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered,
                  and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.</p>

                <p>“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the
                  owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of
                  his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must
                  look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”</p>

                <p>The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
                  Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to
                  a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to
                  his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the
                  owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of
                  unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to
                  his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible
                  agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as
                  much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.</p>

                <p>“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that
                  has befallen us?”</p>

                <p>“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”</p>

                <p>“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,
                  as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as
                  that of Morrel &amp; Son,” replied Danglars.</p>

                <p>“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the
                  anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so
                  old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend
                  Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction
                  from anyone.”</p>

                <p>“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes,
                  he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the
                  captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without
                  consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the
                  Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”</p>

                <p>“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty
                  as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba,
                  he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”</p>

                <p>“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M.
                  Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
                  pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”</p>

                <p>“Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this
                  way!”</p>

                <p>“In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to
                  the crew, he said, “Let go!”</p>

                <p>The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the
                  port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the
                  pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast
                  the colors, and square the yards!”</p>

                <p>“You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my
                  word.”</p>

                <p>“And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.</p>

                <p>“Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”</p>

                <p>“And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is
                  true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”</p>

                <p>A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.</p>

                <p>“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now
                  rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”</p>

                <p>Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped
                  at the Island of Elba?”</p>

                <p>“I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain
                  Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”</p>

                <p>“Then did you see him, Edmond?”</p>

                <p>“Who?”</p>

                <p>“The marshal.”</p>

                <p>“Yes.”</p>

                <p>Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said
                  suddenly—</p>

                <p>“And how is the emperor?”</p>

                <p>“Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”</p>

                <p>“You saw the emperor, then?”</p>

                <p>“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”</p>

                <p>“And you spoke to him?”</p>

                <p>“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.</p>

                <p>“And what did he say to you?”</p>

                <p>“Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the
                  course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not
                  been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
                  told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &amp;
                  Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners
                  from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same
                  regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”</p>

                <p>“Pardieu! and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And
                  that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès,
                  you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see
                  it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued
                  he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to
                  follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it
                  were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had
                  conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.”</p>
